# stereology
Is stereological sampling effective for non-uniform density distributions?

##Research Question
"Is there an optimal number of sampling sites to survey a retinal wholemount, such that it reduces the total number of sites, is still conducive to low-error smoothing, and the result will match an independent sampling on an alternative grid?"

We look to provide reasonable tips for selecting a good sample number.

##Methods
Stochastic permutation and consider the robustness of our findings, thereby giving a solid number of sampling sites that would be optimal for the mouse retina.

##Tasks in order:
Secure a retinal sample with high sampling density
Decide on flowchart for entire paper
Decide on what 5 figures to include, and pre-draw PDF versions of them (with hypothesis/fake data) via R.
Write and submit the abstract to Journal via an informal presubmission inquiry.
Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion written (with results-based discussion points listed in order)
Code the analysis techniques required to generate the plots.
All figures finalized by 
Manuscript ready for peer review
